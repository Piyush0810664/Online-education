            <P class="sectiontag text-big">Education in India</P>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5.

                India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary education. In 2011, Approximately
                75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.[5] India's improved education system
                is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[6] Much of the progress,
                especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public
                institutions. While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching
                a Gross Enrollment Ratio of 24% in 2013,[7] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with
                tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,[8] a challenge that will be necessary to
                overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young
                population.</p>

            <P class="sectiontag text-big">Open and distance learning</P>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">At the school level, National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS)
                provides opportunities for continuing education to those who missed completing school education. 14 lakh
                students are enrolled at the secondary and higher secondary level through open and distance
                learning.[98] In 2012 various state governments also introduced "State Open School" to provide distance
                education.[99]

                At higher education level, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) co-ordinates distance
                learning. It has a cumulative enrolment of about 15 lakh, serviced through 53 regional centres and 1,400
                study centres with 25,000 counselors. The Distance Education Council (DEC), an authority of IGNOU is
                co-co-ordinating 13 State Open Universities and 119 institutions of correspondence courses in
                conventional universities. While distance education institutions have expanded at a very rapid rate, but
                most of these institutions need an up gradation in their standards and performance. There is a large
                proliferation of courses covered by distance mode without adequate infrastructure, both human and
                physical. There is a strong need to correct these imbalances.[100]

                Massive open online course are made available for free by the HRD ministry and various educational
                institutes.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">In the Indian education system, a teacher's success is loosely defined.
                It is either based on a student's success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do
                not necessarily correlate to a teacher's skill set or competencies. The management of an institution
                could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, both
                of which are often not an indicator of a good teacher.[152] This means that either a primary school
                teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the
                institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills
                and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager.
                Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any
                professional development. Thus, there is a need to identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career
                path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.[153]</p>
